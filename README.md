> - Therefore `we recommend that you run it on Android or The Web` only to avoid any bugs that may occur as a result of running it on the other platforms that we haven't tested yet.
> - We also recommend using the following IDEâ€™s `Android Studio`, `Visual Studio Code` and `IntelliJ` while running the application since those are the ones we used during our production process.
